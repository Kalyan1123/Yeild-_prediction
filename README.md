Crop Yield Prediction
This repository contains code and resources for predicting crop yields using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data on weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop yields, our models aim to provide accurate predictions for future crop yields.

Features
Data preprocessing scripts to clean and format raw data.
Various machine learning models including regression, random forests, and neural networks.
Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and visualization.
Getting Started
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/rkalyanchary423/crop-yield-prediction.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run data preprocessing scripts: python preprocess.py
Train and evaluate models using Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical records of weather conditions, soil properties, and crop yields for multiple years and locations. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository. However, instructions for obtaining and formatting the dataset are provided in the data/README.md file.

Models
We experimented with several machine learning models to predict crop yields, including linear regression, random forests, and deep neural networks. Each model is implemented using popular libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of our models using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared. Additionally, we conduct cross-validation to assess the generalization ability of the models.
